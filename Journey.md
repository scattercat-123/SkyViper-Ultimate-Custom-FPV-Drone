# SkyViper | The Ultimate Custom FPV Drone üéÆüöÅ for under 350$ (not including goggles)

<b>Warning: </b><i>May have some bad English sry!</i>

## What I plan to create:
 - An FPV Drone with around 5-8km Range
 - Must be able to do freestyle Moves and stunts
 - It will have the power and agility to dive and move fast
 - I need to make a custom PCB, either for lighting or GPS etc..
 - Custom 3D-Printed Mounts to Fit Your Comfort
 - Uses minimum weight and has considerable flight time
 - <b>Needs to be beginner friendly and you can have loads of fun building</b> <- Overexaggerated
 - Should be under 350-300 dollars without the goggles.

<b>Why I can make this drone? </b>: Cause im sigma.

<b><i>THIS JOURNEY IS UPDATED EVERY DAY AND ALL PROGRESS CAN BE FIND BY DOING CTRL+F TO FIND SPECIFIC STUFF</i> sorry for advanced about the grammar</b>

## Day 1 : Research Day
<b>Time Taken: 3-4hrs</b>

Today I spent most of the day researching about what parts to buy and since I am a begginer in fpv(although having experience with rc) i didnt get any shit about fpv drones. i found out the difference between analog and digital Cameras and Goggles which you can see below:

<img src="https://news.quadpartpicker.com/content/images/2024/02/w8w7yb57vsd31.webp" height="200px">
You can notice that analog has very severe image feed and degrades as you go far from the goggles and transmitter.

I also concluded that 5" FPV drones are suitable for begginer builds and are best for freestyle and tricks.
i found out which goggles i would use and which camera i would be using for a digital setup.
i was thinking to use the dji goggles 2 and caddyx vista with caddx nebula pro hd:

That is it for Day 1.

## Day 2 : Another Research Day lol i am new to fpvv
<b>Time Taken: 5hrs</b>

Today, I had seen:
 - Which ESC To use
 - Which Gps module and buzzer to use
 - find some overly fu****g expensive goggles from dji (second hand)

for the esc i will be using the speedy bee f405 stack which has a esc and flight controller included. it also had a led pin for neopixels which i plan to design a custom pcb later!

This esc is pretty cool and you can add literally anything you can imagine.
Helpfull video i saw [F405 Stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIDomCqX6No)

Btw i also made a BOM which looks shitty rn
[Dumb BOM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hrb5sHN5tFeTms5Vuv9qXKcgenCcHvxhi3MSpN7YOBo/edit?usp=sharing)

I have researched a cheap buzzer, erls receiver, transmitter, gps module on a really good supplier on alibaba
Me getting rejected literally after all the final cost given:

And yeah dont talk about the FPV goggles since yeah.. very overpriced i need to pay from my pocket:

## Day 3 : Researched More About motors and PCB compatiblity
<b>Time Taken: 5hrs</b>

Started some of my cad:
yeah

## Day 4 : Motor Madness and Frame Confusion üòµ‚Äçüí´
Time Taken: 4-5hrs

Brooo today was just motor chaos fr. I thought choosing motors would be easy, like ‚Äúget some fast ones‚Äù, but nope. KV values, stator sizes, efficiency, thrust tables ‚Äî brain fried ‚ò†Ô∏è

Anyway, I finally figured it out:

Settled for EMAX Eco II 2807 1300KV motors

These give mad torque, can handle 6S LiPo, and are kinda made for freestyle and heavy builds

Found out 1300KV is a sweet spot for both power + some flight time

Also matched up good with 5-inch props (DAL Cyclones maybe?)

Also realized frame matters a lot more than I thought.

Some frames can‚Äôt handle big motors or props rubbing ü§¶

So I chose the SpeedyBee FS225 frame ‚Äî roomy, solid, cheap.

Learned that you gotta check motor bolt pattern + frame arms + ESC rating or stuff won‚Äôt even fit lmao.

Also, I designed a basic 3D mount in Fusion360 for the GPS ‚Äî will 3D print in TPU later
üß† Pro tip: TPU good for crash resistance; PLA = death üíÄ

So far so good. Still broke though. DJI goggles gonna sell my kidney üíÄ
Also someone tell me how to make PCBs not look like spaghetti wires pls üôè

## Day 5-10
Time Taken: 15Hrs

Grinded on cad.
.
.
Dont ask

## Day 5-10 yeah forgot to tell you the secrets
I CHOSE ALMOOST EVERY COMPONENT WRONG
CHeck the BOMB
I mean BOM:
These are the updated component [click if you arent dumb](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hrb5sHN5tFeTms5Vuv9qXKcgenCcHvxhi3MSpN7YOBo/edit?usp=sharing)

My shitty kinda cad:

## Day 11 Final Cad finishes
Time Taken: 5 hrs

Check my final cad:
[cad](https://a360.co/45HCMao)
I added few 3d printed mounts for my components but since cad not very precise(i had to sketch every fudging components manually)
i didnt include the mounts

## Day 11-13: PCB Day oh shit.
Time taken: 4 hrs

I am not an expert on pcb but still
I finished the PCB
I researched on very light lighting system so heres the final one!-

## Day 14-18
Time taken: 10 hrs
I just planned to design my own fpv gogggles for cheap!
It is a digital goggles and is cheaper and better than most of the goggles! It is about 300 dollars.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fbb660c-b124-4445-a827-6a00a6f8170a)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b07fff7-29cd-4bdd-bd13-8e92582ba319)

Check it out!

It uses a mini 5 inch hdmi display which is connected to the walksnail a avatar vrx which is connected to the 1s lite camera on the drone!
Also ordering custom lenses from china for better quality and cheap!


## Day 19
Time Taken: 1 hr

Few more adjustments and submitting to the hackclub highway-pitsotop channel!

Yeah another good project!

Check out my other projects on my github page.

If you made it here - sorry for my bad grammar lol.
