# SkyViper | The Ultimate Custom FPV Drone üéÆüöÅ for under 350$ (not including goggles)

<b>Warning: </b><i>May have some bad English sry!</i>

## What I plan to create:
 - An FPV Drone with around 5-8km Range
 - Must be able to do freestyle Moves and stunts
 - It will have the power and agility to dive and move fast
 - I need to make a custom PCB, either for lighting or GPS etc..
 - Custom 3D-Printed Mounts to Fit Your Comfort
 - Uses minimum weight and has considerable flight time
 - <b>Needs to be beginner friendly and you can have loads of fun building</b> <- Overexaggerated
 - Should be under 350-300 dollars without the goggles.

<b>Why I can make this drone? </b>: Cause im sigma.

## Day 1
<b>Time Taken: 3-4hrs</b>

Today I spent most of the day researching about what parts to buy and since I am a begginer in fpv(although having experience with rc) i didnt get any shit about fpv drones. i found out the difference between analog and digital Cameras and Goggles which you can see below:

You can notice that analog has very severe image feed and degrades as you go far from the goggles and transmitter.

I also concluded that 5" FPV drones are suitable for begginer builds and are best for freestyle and tricks.
i found out which goggles i would use and which camera i would be using for a digital setup.
i was thinking to use the dji goggles 2 and caddyx vista with caddx nebula pro hd:

That is it for Day 1.
