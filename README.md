## Yeah, another project but a drone!
What I plan to create:
An FPV Drone with around 5-8km Range
Must be able to do freestyle Moves and stunts
It will have the power and agility to dive and move fast
I need to make a custom PCB, either for lighting or GPS etc..
Custom 3D-Printed Mounts to Fit Your Comfort
Uses minimum weight and has considerable flight time
Needs to be beginner friendly and you can have loads of fun building <- Overexaggerated
Should be under 350-300 dollars without the goggles.
Why I can make this drone? : Cause im sigma.
